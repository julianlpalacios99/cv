            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>I have been working as a professional front-end developer since March 2020 and am proficient in using HTML, CSS, SCSS, and Javascript to develop websites and mobile applications for iOS and Android. My experience in this areais primarily for government clients. I am also particularly interested in accessibility and make compatibility of my work with different device sizes and browsers as well as with different accessibility adjustments a priority. </p>

            <h3>Unity</h3>
            <p>In my current role I have a secondary specialty as a Unity 3D developer. I am capable of both back-end work in C# as well as design work on UI and animations in Unity. I have experience developing both mobile and standalone desktop apps for retail and government clients.</p>

            <h3>Diversity &  Inclusion</h3>
            <p>I am passionate about workplace Diversity and Inclusion and play an active role in my current position at Deloitte as the Queensland Chair of Diversity and Inclusion. I am experienced in event organisation, both physical and virtual/hybrid, as well as in managing a large team and coordinating brainstorming/construction of annual initiative agendas. My particular areas of interest within this space are in championing LGBTI+ inclusion, accesibility and inclusion of neurodiverse colleagues.</p>

            <h3>Assorted sciencey mathsy skills</h3>
            <p>I found my way to work as a developer from an unconventional background, having a physics degree! This means I'm particularly interested in work that has a proximity to scientific research and I also have skills in data analytics and visualisation, MySQL, R, Python and Matlab. My deep understanding of physics and linear algebra also comes in handy with my Unity work.</p>

            <h3>Education and training</h3>
            <p>I am confident and enthusiastic with presenting to an audience, whether this be peers, a client or senior stakeholders. Having years of experience as a private (one-on-one and group tutoring) and university laboratory tutor, I pride myself on my ability to calmly and clearly convey concepts in a way that makes sense to an audience without much technical knowledge, while also saying enough to be useful to those who already know what's going on. To put it plainly, I am excellent at building client rapport, and an excellent choice to train clients on how to use the software solutions I provide them (e.g. content authoring using a CMS to a website I built).</p>
